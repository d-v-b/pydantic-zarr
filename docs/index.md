# pydantic-zarr

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pydantic-zarr)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydantic-zarr)

Static typing and runtime validation for Zarr hiearchies.

## Overview
`pydantic-zarr` expresses data stored in the [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format with [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/). Specifically, `pydantic-zarr` encodes Zarr groups and arrays as [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/models/). Programmers can use `pydantic-zarr` to formalize the structure of Zarr hierarchies, enabling type-checking and runtime validation of Zarr data. 

```python
import zarr
from pydantic_zarr import GroupSpec

group = zarr.group(path='foo')
array = zarr.create(store = group.store, path='foo/bar', shape=10, dtype='uint8')
array.attrs.put({'metadata': 'hello'})

# this is a pydantic model
spec = GroupSpec.from_zarr(group)
print(spec.dict())

        }
    },
}

Important note: this library only provides tools to represent the *layout* of Zarr groups and arrays, and the structure of their attributes. It performs no type checking or runtime validation of the multidimensional array data contained inside Zarr arrays.


## Installation

`pip install -U pydantic-zarr` 

## Design

A Zarr group can be schematized as two elements: 

- `attrs`: Anything JSON serializable, typically dict-like with string keys.
- `items`: dict-like, with keys that are strings and values that are other Zarr groups, or Zarr arrays.

A Zarr array can be schematized similarly, but without the `items` property. 

Note the use of the term "schematized": Zarr arrays also represent N-dimensional array data, but `pydantic-zarr` does not treat that data as part of the "schema" of a Zarr array.

Accordingly, in `pydantic-zarr`, Zarr groups are encoded by the `GroupSpec` class with two fields:

- `GroupSpec.attrs`: either a `Mapping` or a `pydantic.BaseModel`. 
- `GroupSpec.items`: a mapping with string keys and values that must be `GroupSpec` or `ArraySpec` instances.

Zarr arrays are represented by the `ArraySpec` class, which has a similar `attrs` field, as well as fields for all the Zarr array properties (`dtype`, `shape`, `chunks`, etc).

`GroupSpec` and `ArraySpec` are both [generic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/1.10/usage/models/#generic-models). `GroupSpec` takes two type parameters, the first specializing the type of `GroupSpec.attrs`, and the second specializing the type of the *values* of `GroupSpec.items` (they keys of `GroupSpec.items` are always strings). `ArraySpec` only takes one type parameter, which specializes the type of `ArraySpec.attrs`.

Examples using this generic typing functionality can be found in the [usage guide](intro.md#using-generic-types)

## Supported Zarr versions

This library supports [version 2](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html) of the Zarr format. [Zarr v3](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/v3.0.html) will be supported in the near future. Progress towards supporting Zarr v3 is tracked by [this issue](https://github.com/d-v-b/pydantic-zarr/issues/3).

## Supported Pydantic versions

[Pydantic 2.0](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/) was recently released, with many breaking changes compared to 1.xx This library does not yet support Pydantic 2.0. Progress towards adopting Pydantic 2.0 is tracked by [this issue](https://github.com/d-v-b/pydantic-zarr/issues/4).
